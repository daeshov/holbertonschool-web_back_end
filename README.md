What is back-end?
The back-end, often referred to as the "server-side", is the part of a web application that operates behind the scenes. It is responsible for managing and organizing data, implementing the business logic of an application, and communicating with the front-end. It is typically built using languages like Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and frameworks such as Django, Express, or Rails.

The back-end interacts with databases to retrieve, store, or manipulate data, which is then sent to the front-end for display to the user. This process involves the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that act as a bridge between the front-end and back-end. Security, performance, and data integrity are all critical aspects of back-end development.
